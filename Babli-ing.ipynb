    "- We calculate the **sum** of all 9 pixel values in that block.\n",
    "- We compute the **average** by dividing the sum by 9.\n",
    "- Since pixel values are integers, we **round down** the result (using integer division `//` in Python).\n",
    "- We skip the edge pixels because they don't have a complete 3√ó3 neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "- A 2D matrix (`list of lists`) of non-negative integers representing the pixel values.\n",

    "### Candies Distribution Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are solving the problem of distributing `m` candies among `n` children so that:\n",
    "- Each child gets **exactly the same number of whole candies**.\n",
    "- We **maximize** the total number of candies eaten.\n",
    "- Individual candies **cannot** be split.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "We first calculate how many candies each child can get using integer division:\n",
    "`candies_per_child = m // n`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `//` operator gives the quotient without the remainder, which effectively rounds down ‚Äî this is important because candies cannot be split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate the total number of candies eaten:\n",
    "`total_candies = candies_per_child * n`\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the maximum number of candies the group of children can eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Input:\n",
    "- `n`: Number of children (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10)\n",
    "- `m`: Number of candies (2 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Output:\n",
    "- Total candies eaten when divided equally among the children.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Example:\n",
    "For:\n",
    "n = 3  \n",
    "m = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate how many candies each child gets:\n",
    "10 // 3 = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate total candies eaten:\n",
    "3 * 3 = 9\n",

    " Final output: 9\n",

    "### Problem Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string `inputString`, we are tasked with determining whether it can become a palindrome by changing the case of some (possibly none) of the characters. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Palindrome**: A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.\n",
    "2. **Case Insensitivity**: We are only interested in the characters of the string, ignoring their case. This means \"a\" and \"A\" should be treated as the same character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert the String to Lowercase**: \n",
    "   - First, we convert the entire string to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This eliminates any case sensitivity, ensuring that both uppercase and lowercase characters are treated the same.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Check for Palindrome**:\n",
    "   - We can check if a string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version. This can be done easily by slicing the string in reverse (`inputString[::-1]`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Return the Result**: \n",
    "   - If the string is equal to its reversed version, we return `True` (indicating it is a palindrome), otherwise, we return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `inputString.lower()` converts all characters in the string to lowercase.\n",
    "2. `inputString[::-1]` reverses the string.\n",
    "3. The final condition checks if the lowercase string is the same as its reversed version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "1. **Input**: `\"AaBaa\"`\n",
    "   - After converting to lowercase: `\"aabaa\"`\n",
    "   - Reversed: `\"aabaa\"`\n",
    "   - Since both are the same, the output will be `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input**: `\"abac\"`\n",
    "   - After converting to lowercase: `\"abac\"`\n",
    "   - Reversed: `\"caba\"`\n",
    "   - Since they are different, the output will be `False`.\n"
